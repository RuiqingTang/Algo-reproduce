# Algo-reproduce

This repository documents all open-source algorithms that I have reproduced up to this point, as well as the modifications I have made.

Due to there are many algorithms involved, I have placed the more effective algorithms and tool-oriented algorithms at the forefront, with special annotations provided. Because of my limited time and capabilities, I am unable to conduct exhaustive tests on all algorithms, so there may be some shortcomings. Feedback is welcomeüí°.

‚≠ê If you find this repository useful to your research or work, it is really appreciated to star this repository.

‚úâÔ∏è Any additions or suggestions, feel free to contribute and contact [tangruiqing123@gmail.com](tangruiqing123@gmail.com).

Currently, I have integrated text2motion and music2dance into the ü´®Discord community. Due to the unstable server magic and algorithm inefficiency, it is temporarily unavailable for public access. I will continue to update and expect to go live by the end of October.

## Tools{#tools}

1. smpl2fbx

   https://github.com/softcat477/SMPL-to-FBX
   https://www.winehq.org/
   Thanks to the authors for releasing the code. I can convert the SMPL pose parameters into FBX. If you are not familiar with SMPL, you can refer to [the official website](https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/). If you wish to delve deeper, you can also visit this [website](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/). However, there is an issue with the fbx I converted; its initial position is not at the origin of the three-dimensional coordinate system.

   ![](./assets/fbx_issue.png)

   I addressed this issue through some post-processing work. I executed the following command in Blender:

   ```python
   import bpy
   obj = bpy.context.object
   obj.location = (0, 0, -0.3)
   obj.rotation_euler = (3.1, 0, 0)
   ```

   The final result is as follows:

2. smpl2vmd

   https://github.com/rongakowang/MMDMC

   Thanks to the authors for releasing the code. I can convert the SMPL pose parameters into VMD. To be precise, the model used is SMPL+H. SMPL+H includes additional hand information compared to SMPL. I set all these additional hand information to 0, and the program still runs correctly.

   Thanks to the [developer](https://github.com/UuuNyaa) of mmd_toolsÔºà[official website](https://mmd-blender.fandom.com/wiki/MMD_Tools) | [github pages]( https://github.com/UuuNyaa/blender_mmd_tools)). There are still some issues with *IK Toggle*, and I look forward to your subsequent fixes.

3. fbx2vmd

   I'm very sorry, I can no longer find the repository of the author. I found this [repository](https://github.com/tomtomtong/FBXtoVMD), but I haven't verified it yet.

   Through this project, combined with [Unity 2020.3.48f1](https://unity.com/cn/releases/editor/whats-new/2020.3.48#installs), I can convert fbx to vmd. Whether it's an fbx converted from smpl or an fbx downloaded from mixamo, it can all be converted using this tool. However, this conversion is lossy and often results in abnormal movements. Additionally, not all FBX files are supported, leading to issues with bone binding errors.

1. stmc‚ú®

   Code: https://github.com/nv-tlabs/stmc

   Projects Page: https://mathis.petrovich.fr/stmc/

   Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08559

   Note: In fact, STMC is the algorithm that I consider to be the most effective at present. However, due to its stringent requirements for prompts, from an engineering perspective, I had to abandon it, or integrate a LLM to modify the prompts to meet the requirements. In my tests (Prompts are generated by GPT-4) , I disregarded the stringent requirements for prompts, ensuring only that their format was correct. This results in its performance not being as optimal as desired.

   Results: You can check the demo result and my test results [here](https://github.com/RuiqingTang/Algo-reproduce/tree/main/assets/text2motion/stmc).
